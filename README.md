# CourseEight

CourseEight is a comprehensive e-learning platform designed to facilitate online education through interactive courses, assessments, and discussions. The platform serves three main user roles: Students, Instructors, and Administrators.

Instructors can create and manage courses, upload learning materials, create assessments, and engage with students through discussion forums. Students can enroll in courses, access learning materials, participate in discussions, and take assessments to track their progress. Administrators oversee the platform's operations, manage user accounts, and ensure smooth functionality.

The platform features a modern, responsive interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing an optimal learning experience across all devices. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB handling data storage, ensuring scalability and performance.
